==========
This is the ErbstLib library I was writing to explore MuPad 3.1 and 4.06 in 2006-2009.
I hope to tidy the files I had written into a working version 1.0 primarily to refresh my memory about what significant things I was investigating.
II am restricting myself to only including the cleanest single version of each file I have collected, after a google drive sync disaster corrupted most of my MuPad stuff, I will retain bulk code on my DropBox, and library efforts here.
II realise MuPad is a dead language, as SciFace is no longer supporting it anmd has sold their code to Mathematica, but 

I was delightged to learn that SageMath.org has a module completely supporting existing MuPad files!
Ideally I would like to contribute anything novel ErbstLib could proide to the SageMath project after cleaning out features made redundant by its rich libraries.
I look forward to getting my code running on the SageMath Cloud server!
